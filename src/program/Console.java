At first simple ones like ‘what do you do for fun?’ and ‘what’s your favorite part about school?’ but as the questions continued and Claire could feel Noah opening to her she shifted to more probing questions. He began talking about his parents back home and how he always felt like he was being watched due to his strict upbringing. The conversation goes on, and Claire slowly figured out what is going on. “Have you ever thought about trying to be something you’re not?” Claire calmly asks Noah. “Well…” Noah says. He then goes on to detail his struggles with his appearance and that he was never quite sure why he felt differently. After some time, Noah blurts out, “I just hate being a boy!” with tears streaming down his face. These tears are neither happy nor said, but an involuntary response to every emotion flooding Noah’s mind. Claire reassures Noah that his feelings are valid, and that there are plenty of people who feel the exact same way as him. Noah is terrified of what her parents will think but decides it’s what’s best for her. She eventually decided to go by the name Hazel and was met with open arms from Mike and her other friends in the tower.\n\nSelect choice 1 to continue...");

He continued to not attend his classes and play video games until the earliest hours of the morning. He refused to eat more than once a day, and rarely drank water. On the last day of fall semester Mike came back to their dorm with a handle of gin and a gallon of lemonade. “We’re celebrating tonight,” Mike exclaimed, “get your sorry ass out of that computer chair for once, we’re going to a party!” Noah did not want to leave one bit, but the allurement of intoxication was too much this night. In a burst of manic energy, Noah showered, brushed his teeth for the first time in days, and put on a clean pair of clothes that he had been saving for an occasion like this. They left the dorm after a few drinks and headed to a local frat house located just off campus. This wasn’t Noah’s first rodeo, he had gone out drinking with Mike and other friends during High School, but this party was something he could not have expected. He walked into men doing lines of coke and molly on the living room table. Noah tried to leave, but Mike reassured him that this will be the best night of his life. Noah, ten drinks in at this point, was pulled to the living room couch by an equally inebriated Mike. “We’re going to go all out tonight!” Mike said as he lifted the house bong to give to Noah. Without thinking Noah took a hit off the bong. Suddenly his entire world was spinning, and Mike was doing a line of cocaine. Noah did one too, and the last thing he remembered was dancing to I Like It by Cardi B.\n\nSelect choice 1 to continue...");

Steve picked him up from the Towers and drove a few miles to a mutual friend’s house off campus. Before they were about to get out of the car, Steve pulled out a bag with what appeared to be cocaine dyed yellow. “What the fuck is that?” Noah, already high as balls, said. Steve explained that it was a mixture of DXM and cocaine, and that it was the best experience of his life. Noah, visibly excited, pulled out his phone and credit card and started making a line. “Are you sure you want to take that much?” Steve said, “it’s really fucking intense.” Noah did the line anyway, and he immediately started seizing up. His heart rate skyrocketed, and he began shaking uncontrollably. It turned out that he had taken a massive dose, and his body couldn’t handle it.

The duo became friends with almost everyone on their floor. The residents of Taylor Hall were social and adventurous. It was common for large groups of more than ten people to be in the lounge at once. Noah was shy when it came to change clothes in front of others, and usually requested that he and Brad change in the bathroom instead of their shared room space. Noah thought it was gay to see other men naked. One day, Brad came rushing into the room drenched in mud and rain. Someone had almost hit him as he was biking home and Brad crashed into a nearby ditch. As Brad was taking off his clothes, Noah noticed discolored lines a few inches below Brad’s nipples. Curious about the unusual markings, Noah asked Brad what they were. “Oh those?” Brad responded, “those are just the scars from my breast reduction surgery.” It turned out that Brad was transgender. “That’s so amazing,” Noah said after finding out, “I didn’t realize people were like that, it’s so cool!” Noah was suddenly flooded with memories of when he was younger. He had never met someone who was transgender in real life, and barely understood that it was a real thing due to his upbringing. Suddenly, Noah realized that he could empathize with Brad’s hardships. She was Transgender. Even though she was positive about how she felt, she attended therapy to keep her mental health in check. She was referred to a doctor on campus who prescribed her hormones and reassured her that her parents would not find out. Her and Brad spent a week in the fall semester poring through every female name in the book. She finally decided on Hazel. However, she lived in an all-male room and on an all-male floor.
